# Quick Issues

## Project pm

1. Dashboard has a good list of projects - add a "New Project" button to the top right of the page, and then we won't need the Projects page as it seems redundant.
2. Dashboard latest activity should take into account latest commits or activity in the local git repository.
3. Dashboard projects table should be sortable and default by last activity.
4. the PM project should have a Claude Skill that can be added to Claude Code.
5. Issues page needs a quick way to change status of multiple issues. Right now when you select multiple issues, the only action you can do is launch agent.
6. We need a way to improve the ui of the projects page as it pertains to all the Closed issues. Closed issues are starting to pile up and aren't as useful to have on the issues page by default.

## Project wt

1. Need to add a MCP server that can be used by Claude Code and the PM project to create and manage worktrees.
2. The WT project should have a Claude Skill that can be added to Claude Code.
